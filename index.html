			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Hello, my name is Alexander and I'm an aspiring web developer from Lake County, California. I am currently taking advantage of the Odin Project and loving every minute of it.</p>
			<p>I'm originally from the 818 (NoHo) and have lived in the Riviera for half a year now. Currently attending school for a B.S. in Computer Science, but feeling like it's a waste of time and money so I'm dropping out after this semester. Our <em>little</em> secret.</p>
			<h3>Why am I learning Web Development?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Give my computer some attention...</li>
				<li>To show off
					<ol>
						<li>To my boss</li>
						<li>To my friends</li>
						<li>To my cat (no, I don't have a cat)</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Get a new job!</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Jokes aside, I'm studying web development because I <strong>love</strong> art and technology. Prior to studying Computer Science, I was a Fine Arts major in Pasadena but struggled with the feeling of not being taught "real world" skills that would land me a job. Unfortunately, Computer Science departments are also struggling to prepare students for positions so I've come to the conclusion that:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>College isn't what it used to be...</em><br>
			Fortunately, web development has come a long way and is capable of utilizing artistic skillsets becoming the perfect area for someone like me! Art aside, I also have a strong logical side to me and love programming, so my goal is to become a full-stack developer one day.</p>
			<p>Thank you to everyone @ <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> for making my dreams a reality.</p>

			    <h5><blockquote>"You're gonna get an education, that's nice, but if you don't use your gift, that education's only gonna take you so far ... The only way for you to soar is you got to jump. You got to take that gift that's packed away on your back, you got to jump off that cliff and pull that cord. That gift opens up and provides the soar.
			    <br><br>

			    When you first jump, your parachute will not open right away. I'm sorry, I wish I could tell you it did, but it don't. You gonna hit them rocks. You gonna get some skin tore off on those cliffs ... you're going to be bleeding pretty bad. But eventually, the parachute has to open.
			    <br><br>

			    You can play it safe and deal without the cuts and the tears and you can stand on the cliff of life forever safe, but if you don't jump ... your parachute will never open."
